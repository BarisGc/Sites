 1) Tooltip'de tek ya da çift quote olmalı çünkü boşluk varsa veya göbek adı gibi quote varsa sıkıntı olur.
İhtiyaca göre tek tırnaklar içinde çift tırnaka alınmış kelime veya tam tersi şeklinde quote yapılabilir.
2) Horizontal rule şudur: <hr>    : ------------------------------
3) A screen reader will pronounce the words in <em> with an emphasis, using verbal stress.
4) The HTML <strong> element defines text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold.
5) The HTML <ins> element defines a text that has been inserted into a document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text:
<p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> <ins>red</ins>.</p>
6) Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H2O:
7) Superscript text can be used for footnotes(dipnot), like WWW[1]:
8) Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.
Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element. 
9)The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element.
10)Note: A person's name is not the title of a work.
The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic.
11) <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">  bu cite ile
bu cite -10.madde- <p><cite>The Scream</cite> by Edvard Munch. Painted in 1893.</p>
farklı!
12) <p>If your browser supports bi-directional override (bdo), 
the next line will be written from right to left (rtl):</p>
<bdo dir="rtl">This line will be written from right to left</bdo>
13) Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all three parameters:
14)Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. 
So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, 
and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!
15)The <caption> tag must be inserted immediately after the <table> tag.
16)Use the CSS property float:left to display a list horizontally
17)
CSS NOTLAR:

1) CSS LINKS: CURSOR, HOVER, ACTIVE, VISITED
2) link propery sıralamaları: * hover after link and visited * active after hover
3) Table-layout property: The main benefit of table-layout: fixed; is that the table renders much faster. 
On large tables, users will not see any part of the table until the browser has rendered the whole table. 
So, if you use table-layout: fixed, users will see the top of the table while the browser loads and renders 
rest of the table. This gives the impression that the page loads a lot quicker!
4) float + clear: When clearing floats, you should match the clear to the float: If an element is floated to the left, then you should clear to the left. Your floated element will continue to float
, but the cleared element will appear below it on the web page.
5) We also use the box-sizing property to make sure that the box doesn't break due to extra padding.
6) line-height: For example, 12px font-size and 4px distant from the bottom and upper lines:
line-height: 20px; /* 4px +12px + 4px */
7) Navigasyon-Menüler: *Değişebilir* yatayda inline-block, dikeyde block kullan
8) Pseudo-Element: The ::first-line and ::first-letter pseudo-element can only be applied to block-level elements.
9) Tooltip: span:hover + div {
  display: block;
}
10) %100 width: When you give an element a width of 100% in CSS, you’re basically saying “Make this element’s content area exactly equal to the explicit width of its parent — but only if its parent has an explicit width.”
11) Combinators: Lİ+Lİ
12) Top and bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the two margins.
This does not happen on horizontal (left and right) margins! Only vertical (top and bottom) margins!
13) @media: meaning of the not, only and and keywords: The not keyword inverts the meaning of an entire media query.
only: The only keyword prevents older browsers that do not support media queries with media features from applying the specified styles. It has no effect on modern browsers.
and: The and keyword combines a media feature with a media type or other media features.
They are all optional. However, if you use not or only, you must also specify a media type.
14) Hidden elements take up space on the page. Use the display property to both hide and remove an element from the document layout!
15) content içindeki font için size belirlemezsen göremezsin xD bu arada content "" şeklinde yani boş olursa borderlar her yeri kaplıyor büyük oranda. Bunu arrow yapmak için kullan.
